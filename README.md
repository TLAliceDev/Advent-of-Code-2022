# Advent of Code2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

For this year I challenged myself to do every day in a different programming language, some of which I was already familiar with, some of which were my first time using those languages.

The languages used were the following:

| Day | Language Used   |
|-----|-----------------|
| 1   | C               |
| 2   | Python          |
| 3   | TypeScript      |
| 4   | Clojure         |
| 5   | To Be Completed |
| 6   | PHP             |
| 7   | To Be Completed |
| 8   | D               |
| 9   | Scala           |
